# Data-Reduction

This repository contains two projects focused on big data analysis and reduction techniques (both provided as .ipynb files as well as .html for ease of reading). One is an experiment in which we work with satellite data and explore how to estimate the background distribution of 'real' (i.e. messy) data. The other is a data reduction exercise using a stack of telescope images.
